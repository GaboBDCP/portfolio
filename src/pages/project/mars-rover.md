ðŸ‘‰ Why did we build NFT Price Floor?

The current creator economy relies on centralized social networks/content distribution platforms (Web 2.0) that extract value and have the ability to censor users.

Web3 will disrupt this model using NFTs as monetization vehicles, allowing the creator economy to grow

unrestricted.

In the future, NFTs will be a part of everyday life, so we thought that the community deserved a nice dashboard to keep track of the markets!

ðŸ’ª We aim to be the gateway for anyone interested in NFTs, providing a reliable data source for investors to make informed decisions, as well as educational resources for newcomers - everything is freely available for everyone!
